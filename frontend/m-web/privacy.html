        </h4>
        <p>
            Christie’s group of companies (“we” or “us”) consider the privacy and protection of our clients' data, both
            corporate and personal, to be of the utmost importance and we take robust measures across our business to

            and use of personal data. This policy (together with our terms of use and any other documents referred to on
            it) sets out the basis on which we will collect, use and process personal data. Please read this Privacy
            Policy carefully to ensure you understand how we handle your personal data; please also check this page from

            SPECIFIC INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT VIA WWW.CHRISTIES.COM
        </h4>
        <p>
            We may collect and process the following information obtained from your use of www.christies.com.

        <h4>
            Cookies
        </h4>
        <p>
            A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and
            only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your
            web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and
            some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your
            shopping basket. Using our website will result in us placing cookies on your computer in the 3 categories
            set out below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strictly necessary:These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the website and use its
            features, such as accessing secure areas of the website; many of the functions on our website will not work
            properly, or at all, if you do not allow these cookies to be used. We may therefore be unable to provide
            many of the services you may wish to request unless you accept the use of these cookies.

        <p>
            Performance:These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages
            visitors go to most often. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor: all
            information these cookies collect is aggregated and is therefore anonymous. The information is only used to
            improve how the website works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Functionality:These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language
            or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features (for example, remembering changes you
            have made to text size and fonts).

            If you reside outside the EU, we also use a fourth type of cookie for Targeting or Advertising:

            Targeting or Advertising:We sometimes partner with third parties to deliver more relevant advertisements and
            to compile web statistics. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technology to
            monitor your visits to both Christie’s and other websites. They monitor your online behaviour and identify
            website usage, helping advertisers show you advertising and content that is more relevant to you. Some

            is relevant to you.

        </p>
        <p>
            Don't worry - none of these cookies store personally identifiable information and we only use trusted
            advertising partners. Just so you know, these third parties will have their own privacy policies and they
            may be different from ours.

            LotFinder®
        </h4>

            Christie’s provides users of www.christies.com the opportunity to inform others (each, a “recipient”) about
            a sale or lot for sale, which will require the sender to provide us with the recipient’s email address(es).
            At the sender’s request, Christie’s will automatically send the recipient an email on behalf of the sender
            containing a link to Christie’s site which has the information about the sale or lot. Christie’s will not
            initiate any further contact with the recipient, beyond the email sent on behalf of the sender, unless the
            recipient specifically “subscribes” for extra services by filling out a registration form.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you, as a recipient, do not wish to receive further e-mails from the sender and Christies, please reply
            to the sender requesting they stop sending you the email in the future. Christie’s does not accept
            responsibility for any third party’s use (or misuse) of this service.
